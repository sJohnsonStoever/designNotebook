### Origin ###
I wanted to use a stylesheet for my Design Notebook inspired by the website for the MIT disobedience project ([http://disobedience.mit.edu/](http://disobedience.mit.edu/)). The style used by this webpage is called **bbv1** by Aaron Adams, and is dated June 2009. The style is provided under the GNU GPL license, and therefore so is any style produced under my project.

Due to my desire to use a multimarkdown based workflow to edit and publish my notebook, the stylesheet mentioned above is not usable, as the multimarkdown parser will not produce many of the relevant tags, and writing these tags directly into the document defeats the purpose of using multimarkdown in the first place. 

### Usage ###
The style expects three sections to the document:

1. Header
2. Sidebar
3. Entry
